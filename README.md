# Titanic_linear_regression
TitanicSurvivalPrediction_ML

Description:
This machine learning project, implemented in Python using scikit-learn, focuses on predicting the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic. The project includes comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of linear regression for predictive modeling.

Features:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Addresses missing values, outliers, and ensures data quality for accurate predictions.
Implements feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducts exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of variables and relationships within the Titanic dataset.
Visualizes key patterns and trends relevant to survival predictions.
Linear Regression Modeling:

Utilizes scikit-learn's linear regression module for building a predictive model.
Selects relevant features and trains the model on cleaned data to predict survival probabilities.
Predictions and Evaluation:

Applies the trained model to make predictions on new or test data.
Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Jupyter Notebooks for Documentation:

Organizes the project into Jupyter notebooks for clear documentation of the data cleaning process, EDA, and the machine learning model implementation.
Enables users to follow step-by-step explanations and reproduce the results.
